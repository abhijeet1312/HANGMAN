# HANGMAN
### Hangman Game

The Hangman Game is an engaging word-guessing challenge where players must identify a hidden name by guessing one letter at a time. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to guess the correct name before running out of lives.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns guessing letters.
   - If a player guesses a letter that is part of the name, they successfully reveal that letter in its correct position(s) and retain their current lives.
   - If the guessed letter is not in the name, the player loses one life.

3. **Lives**: Each player starts with a total of **6 lives**. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses the name or loses all their lives.

Enjoy the challenge of the Hangman Game, and may your guessing skills lead you to victory!
